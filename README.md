## Installation

In the working folder of this application run 'npm i'.  Additionally, in the db folder, using mySQL CLI, run 'source schema.sql'.  Note if the test data is needed for training, additionally run 'source seeds.sql' (when training is complete, run 'source schema.sql' a FINAL time to set system for use. Note this will delete everything in the database. NEVER run this command if you do not have a complete working knowledge of it's functionality.)

## Usage

After installation, run 'node server.js' to begin using this application.
